  abstract = {"Even the smartest among us can feel inept as we fail to figure out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

  abstract = {In a series of studies we addressed the two questions of: 1) Do verbalizations reflect concurrent thought, and 2) Does concurrent thinking aloud differ from normal thinking? The design of experimental tests was based upon Ericsson and Simon's model of thinking aloud, incorporating variations of how information is represented in short term memory. Eye-movement recordings were used as a source of additional data, allowing us to go beyond a mere analysis of solution time and accuracy. Comparing verbalizations and eye-movement data, we arrived at a positive answer to the first of our initial questions. The second question was approached on several levels, always involving a comparison of ‘think-aloud groups’ with silent controls. We found no differences with respect to accuracy, but longer solution times in think-aloud groups. In a final experiment, the influence of thinking aloud on concurrent task performance could be narrowed down to an effect which only persists through the early stages of familiarization with tasks. We conclude that concurrent verbalization is a viable tool in the study of cognitive processes.},
