  author = {Hellmann, Jonathon D.},

  institution = {{Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University}},
  abstract = {Block-based programming languages were originally designed for educational purposes. Due to their low requirements for a user’s programming capability, such languages have great potential to serve both introductory programmers in educational settings as well as domain experts as a data processing tool. However, the current design of block-based languages fails to address critical factors for these two audiences: 1) domain experts do not have the ability to perform crucial steps: import data sources, perform efficient data processing, and visualize results; 2) the focus of online assignments towards introductory programmers on entertainment (e.g. games, animation) fails to convince students that computer science is important, relevant, and related to their day-to-day experiences. In this thesis, we present the design and implementation of DataSnap, which is a block-based programming language extended from Snap!. Our work focuses on enhancing the state of the art in block-based programming languages for our two target audiences: domain experts and introductory programmers. Specifically, in this thesis we: 1) provide easy-to-use interfaces for big data import, processing, and visualization methods for domain experts; 2) integrate relevant social media, geographic, and business-related data sets into online educational platforms for introductory programmers and enable teachers to develop their own real-time and big-data access blocks; and 3) present DataSnap in the Open edX online courseware platform along with customized problem definition and a dynamic analysis grading system. Stemming from our research contributions, our work encourages the further development and utilization of block-based languages towards a broader audience range.}

After participants finished a scenario, they completed the After-Scenario Questionnaire (the ASQ). A factor analysis of the responses to the ASQ items revealed that an eight-factor solution explained 94 percent of the variability of the 24 (eight scenarios by three items per scenario) items. The varimax-rotated factor pattern showed that these eight factors were clearly associated with the eight scenarios. The benefit of this research to system designers is that this three-item questionnaire has acceptable psychometric properties of reliability, sensitivity, and concurrent validity, and may be used with confidence in other, similar usability studies.},

The resultant ratio-scale data is appropriate for parametric statistical analysis. This method has been used successfully in a variety of usability activities at Oracle.

The fault, argues this ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in product design that ignores the needs of users and the principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis, cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the most important key to regaining the competitive edge in influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated, with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.

  abstract = {In a series of studies we addressed the two questions of: 1) Do verbalizations reflect concurrent thought, and 2) Does concurrent thinking aloud differ from normal thinking? The design of experimental tests was based upon Ericsson and Simon's model of thinking aloud, incorporating variations of how information is represented in short term memory. Eye-movement recordings were used as a source of additional data, allowing us to go beyond a mere analysis of solution time and accuracy. Comparing verbalizations and eye-movement data, we arrived at a positive answer to the first of our initial questions. The second question was approached on several levels, always involving a comparison of ‘think-aloud groups’ with silent controls. We found no differences with respect to accuracy, but longer solution times in think-aloud groups. In a final experiment, the influence of thinking aloud on concurrent task performance could be narrowed down to an effect which only persists through the early stages of familiarization with tasks. We conclude that concurrent verbalization is a viable tool in the study of cognitive processes.},

The methods included simple Likert scales as well as a technique derived from Usability Magnitude Estimation. They were tested in a large-scale online study in which participants performed six tasks on an Intranet site. Performance data for the tasks reflected the same pattern as all of the subjective ratings. All five methods yielded significant differences in the subjective ratings for the tasks. A sub-sampling analysis showed that one method yielded the most reliable results at the small sample sizes typical of usability tests.},
